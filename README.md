# abk_king_lear
In October 2019, comedian Alasdair Beckett-King performed a [version of King Lear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkIrDMLDDjs) where he recited the 115 most frequently used words from the play as if it were actual Shakespeare text. 

This project attempts to recalculate those 115 most frequently used words. 
It scrapes data from Project Gutenberg, and organises the words therefrom in frequency order.
It finds that some poetic license has been used for dramatic purposes, proving there's more to being a YouTube sensation than programming word-frequencies in Python.

The analysis can be found in the file "KingLear.ipynb"
